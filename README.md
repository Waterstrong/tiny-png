To compress and optimize JPEG and PNG images with [Tinify API in Python](https://tinypng.com/developers/reference/python).

## Usage

The TinyPNG script can compress all case insensitive `*.jpg|*.jpeg|*.png` target image or images in target directory recursively.
```
Usage:
   tinypng  <target_image>
   tinypng  <target_directory>
```

Checkout the cache file `.tinify.cache` in each target directory. It can prevent duplicated compression.

Checkout the log file `<your_dir>/tiny-png/tinify.log` for compression details log.

**IMPORTANT:** The script will compress all case insensitive `*.jpg|*.jpeg|*.png` target image or images in target directory recursively.
